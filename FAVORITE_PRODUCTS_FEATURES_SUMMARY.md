## Implementation Details

### Priority System
The discount system implements a clear priority:
1. **Manual Discounts** (Product-specific or General) - Highest priority
2. **Birthday Discounts** (10% for favorite products) - Secondary priority

### Notification System
The notification system includes:
- **In-app Notifications**: Stored in the Notifikasi model
- **Email Notifications**: Sent using Django's email backend
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing notifications on the same day

### Favorite Products Logic
The favorite products logic:
- Identifies top 3 purchased products for each customer
- Only applies to customers who qualify for birthday discounts (loyal + birthday)
- Works in both display and calculation contexts

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing
1. Create a customer with sufficient purchase history (>Rp 5,000,000)
2. Set customer's birthday to today
3. Add products to cart and verify discount application
4. Check that favorite products are highlighted in product list
5. Verify email notifications are sent (visible in console)

### Edge Cases Handled
- Customers without email addresses
- Products without sufficient stock
- Duplicate notifications on the same day
- New products without images

## Future Enhancements

### Production Email Configuration
For production deployment, update the email configuration in settings.py:
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'your-smtp-server.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@domain.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-password'
```

### Performance Improvements
- Add caching for favorite products queries
- Implement asynchronous email sending
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
